        <p class="image-text">The Big Bang Theory proposes 
          that the universe originated from a singularity,
           a point of infinite density and temperature, 
           approximately 13.8 billion years ago.According to the theory, 
           the universe rapidly expanded from this singularity in an 
           event known as cosmic inflation. This expansion continues to this day.</p>

        <p class="image-text">The observation of galaxies moving away from us, 
          as indicated by their redshifted light, 
          supports the idea of an expanding universe.
           Edwin Hubble's work on galaxy redshifts played a crucial role in confirming the theory.One of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the Big Bang Theory is the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is a faint glow of
           radiation that fills the universe and is
            the remnant of the initial explosion.</p>
